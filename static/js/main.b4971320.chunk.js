So far, in the literature, there is not a clear-cut difference between fog and edge computing, which may be confusing when defining edge and fog environments; however, it is essential to differentiate both paradigms. Edge computing concentrates on the end-devices side, while fog computing concentrates on the infrastructure. Edge computing is the layer that performs local computing or sensor metering. It is worth pointing out that edge computing environments run specific applications in the end-devices (e.g., self-driving cars, healthcare monitors, etc.). On the other hand, fog computing is an extension of the cloud computing paradigm, where the computational resources are extended to near the edge devices. Services are also provided by fog computing environments, which can be used through the Internet or private networks. My Master's dissertation was about autoscaling of virtual machines in cloud computing environments, where I used time-series forecasting to predict the most suitable moment to perform the scaling activity.

However, most poultry farmers still use conventional methods of operation in which human workers carry out all routines for monitoring and controlling their farms at the expense of greater productivity. One of these human activities is manual weighing, which can be replaced by non-intrusive methods such as computational vision applications that estimate live poultry's weight using video cameras. Since Internet of Things (IoT) devices may have low computing power limiting the ability to process the data locally, they can transfer it to a fog or cloud data center, where they are processed. This paper aims to conduct a dependability study of a poultry house automated with a computer vision-based system for estimating poultry weight considering hierarchical models (e.g., Markov chain, Reliability Block Diagram, and closed-form equation) to represent the whole system and obtain steady-state availability and annual downtime. In addition, our purpose is to consider and compare different architectural solutions, such as edge and fog computing-based solutions. The proposed solution verified that a cloud-based application with no redundancy has a downtime of 34.14% and 9.176% hours when considering a hot-standby redundancy strategy in the office node of a cloud solution."}),i.a.createElement(N,{year:2022,title:"A performance modeling framework for microservices-based cloud infrastructures",link:"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-022-04967-6",metaData:"The Journal of Supercomputing",abstract:"Microservice architectures (MSAs) can increase the performance of distributed systems and enable better resource allocation by sharing underlying resources among multiple microservices (MSs). One of the main advantages of MSAs is the ability to leverage the elasticity provided by an infrastructure so that only the most demanding services are scaled, which can contribute to efficient allocation of processing resources. A major problem in allocating resources to microservices is determining a set of auto-scaling parameters that will result in all microservices meeting specific service level agreements (SLAs). Since the space of feasible configurations can be vast, manually determining a combination of parameter values that will result in all SLAs being met is complex and time consuming. In addition, the performance overhead caused by running microservices concurrently and the overhead caused by the VM instantiation process must also be evaluated. Another problem is that microservices can suffer performance degradation due to resource contention, which depends on how microservices are distributed across servers. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes the modeling of these infrastructures and their auto-scaling mechanisms in a private cloud using stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), one of the most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization (MOO), and random forest regression (RFR), an ensemble-learning-based method, to identify critical trade-offs between performance and resource consumption considering all deployed MSs. The SPN-based model is capable of representing both instantiation of elastic VMs and a pool of instantiated elastic VMs where only containers are started. The analytical framework enables service providers (SPs) to estimate performance metrics considering configurations that satisfy all performance constraints, use of elastic VMs, discard rate, discard probability, throughput, response time, and corresponding cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). These metrics are critical because they make it possible to estimate the time required to process each request, the number of requests processed in a time interval, the number of requests rejected, and the utilization of resources. The framework was validated with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a real-world testbed. Two case studies were used to investigate its feasibility by evaluating its application in a real scenario. We noticed a significant improvement in performance when using a pool of elastic VMs, where throughput improved by 21.5% and the number of discarded requests decreased by 70%. The application of the framework can help in finding optimized solutions that support both infrastructure planning and online performance prediction, and enable trade-off analyses considering different scenarios and constraints."}),i.a.createElement(N,{year:2022,title:"Availability model for edge-fog-cloud continuum: an evaluation of an end-to-end infrastructure of intelligent traffic management service",link:"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-021-04033-7",metaData:"The Journal of Supercomputing",abstract:"Our world is being transformed by connectivity and technology as time goes by, which requires continuous improvement of quality of service (QoS) levels in the systems.
