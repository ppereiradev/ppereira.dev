Currently, I am living in Recife, an awesome city,\n                located in Pernambuco along the Northeast coast of Brazil.\n                I have a Ph.D. in computer science from\n                Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, which is the same place\n                where I got my Master's degree also in computer science. During\n                my bachelor's degree, I had the opportunity of being an exchange\n                student at the State University of New York at Oswego, where I\n                studied for one year and a half. Over there, I was enrolled in a\n                class of Data Analytics, which made me fall in love with data\n                science and artificial intelligence. I spend most of my time\n                researching and learning about the data science process that\n                starts at the data acquisition and finishes at data\n                visualization, going through all steps, such as data scraping,\n                data cleansing, wrangling and exploration, the model conception,\n                and so on.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div style={{ textIndent: \"2em\" }}>\n              <p>\n                So, talking a little bit about my Ph.D., I researched about\n                modeling the availability and performance of object detection in\n                edge and fog computing environments. So far, in the literature,\n                there is not a clear-cut difference between fog and edge\n                computing, which may be confusing when defining edge and fog\n                environments; however, it is essential to differentiate both\n                paradigms. Edge computing concentrates on the end-devices side,\n                while fog computing concentrates on the infrastructure. Edge\n                computing is the layer that performs local computing or sensor\n                metering. It is worth pointing out that edge computing\n                environments run specific applications in the end-devices (e.g.,\n                self-driving cars, healthcare monitors, etc.). On the other\n                hand, fog computing is an extension of the cloud computing\n                paradigm, where the computational resources are extended to near\n                the edge devices. Services are also provided by fog computing\n                environments, which can be used through the Internet or private\n                networks. My Master's dissertation was about autoscaling of\n                virtual machines in cloud computing environments, where I used\n                time-series forecasting to predict the most suitable moment to\n                perform the scaling activity. Therefore, using my approach, it\n                is possible to decrease the performance degradation of cloud\n                environments.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div style={{ textIndent: \"2em\" }}>\n              <p>\n                I am also a Linux enthusiastic, I love writing scripts and code\n                on Linux terminal.

One of these human activities is manual weighing, which can be replaced by non-intrusive methods such as computational vision applications that estimate live poultry's weight using video cameras. Since Internet of Things (IoT) devices may have low computing power limiting the ability to process the data locally, they can transfer it to a fog or cloud data center, where they are processed. This paper aims to conduct a dependability study of a poultry house automated with a computer vision-based system for estimating poultry weight considering hierarchical models (e.g., Markov chain, Reliability Block Diagram, and closed-form equation) to represent the whole system and obtain steady-state availability and annual downtime. In addition, our purpose is to consider and compare different architectural solutions, such as edge and fog computing-based solutions. The proposed solution verified that a cloud-based application with no redundancy has a downtime of 34.14% and 9.176% hours when considering a hot-standby redundancy strategy in the office node of a cloud solution.\"\n              }\n            />\n\n            <Papers\n              year={2022}\n              title={\n                \"A performance modeling framework for microservices-based cloud infrastructures\"\n              }\n              link={\n                \"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-022-04967-6\"\n              }\n              metaData={\"The Journal of Supercomputing\"}\n              abstract={\n                \"Microservice architectures (MSAs) can increase the performance of distributed systems and enable better resource allocation by sharing underlying resources among multiple microservices (MSs). One of the main advantages of MSAs is the ability to leverage the elasticity provided by an infrastructure so that only the most demanding services are scaled, which can contribute to efficient allocation of processing resources. A major problem in allocating resources to microservices is determining a set of auto-scaling parameters that will result in all microservices meeting specific service level agreements (SLAs). Since the space of feasible configurations can be vast, manually determining a combination of parameter values that will result in all SLAs being met is complex and time consuming. In addition, the performance overhead caused by running microservices concurrently and the overhead caused by the VM instantiation process must also be evaluated. Another problem is that microservices can suffer performance degradation due to resource contention, which depends on how microservices are distributed across servers. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes the modeling of these infrastructures and their auto-scaling mechanisms in a private cloud using stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), one of the most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization (MOO), and random forest regression (RFR), an ensemble-learning-based method, to identify critical trade-offs between performance and resource consumption considering all deployed MSs. The SPN-based model is capable of representing both instantiation of elastic VMs and a pool of instantiated elastic VMs where only containers are started. The analytical framework enables service providers (SPs) to estimate performance metrics considering configurations that satisfy all performance constraints, use of elastic VMs, discard rate, discard probability, throughput, response time, and corresponding cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). These metrics are critical because they make it possible to estimate the time required to process each request, the number of requests processed in a time interval, the number of requests rejected, and the utilization of resources. The framework was validated with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a real-world testbed. Two case studies were used to investigate its feasibility by evaluating its application in a real scenario. We noticed a significant improvement in performance when using a pool of elastic VMs, where throughput improved by 21.5% and the number of discarded requests decreased by 70%. The application of the framework can help in finding optimized solutions that support both infrastructure planning and online performance prediction, and enable trade-off analyses considering different scenarios and constraints.\"\n              }\n            />\n\n            <Papers\n              year={2022}\n              title={\n                \"Availability model for edge-fog-cloud continuum: an evaluation of an end-to-end infrastructure of intelligent traffic management service\"\n              }\n              link={\n                \"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-021-04033-7\"\n              }\n              metaData={\"The Journal of Supercomputing\"}\n              abstract={\n                \"Our world is being transformed by connectivity and technology as time goes by, which requires continuous improvement of quality of service (QoS) levels in the systems.

Cloud computing environments provide high availability, reliability, and performance; however, cloud computing may not be suitable for latency-sensitive applications, such as disaster risk minimization, intelligent traffic management, and crime prevention, for instance. Two complementary paradigms, namely edge and fog computing, have been proposed to overcome the latency issues and increase the computing power between the cloud and edge devices (e.g., controllers, sensors, and smartphones).

The obtained results pointed out that the hyper-converged architecture had an advantage over a full triple redundant environment regarding availability and deployment cost.\"\n              }\n            />\n            <h3 style={{ fontFamily: \"Oxygen, sans-serif\" }}>Conference</h3>\n            {/** Conference*/}\n            <Papers\n              year={2021}\n              title={\n                \"Impact Evaluation of DDoS Attacks Using IoT Devices\"\n              }\n              link={\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9447145/\"}\n              metaData={\n                \"2021 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)\"\n              }\n              abstract={\n                \"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks can occur anytime, everywhere, and most normally occur with little or no warning. Most small and medium businesses (SMBs) usually are not prepared to deal with this type of attack. The companies must have at least a bandwidth higher than the attack, an infrastructure with redundant components, regular backups, and firewalls capable of monitoring the threats. Otherwise, the services provided by the companies' support can be interrupted, increasing the chances of financial losses. Hierarchical modeling approaches are often used to evaluate the availability of such systems. It can represent different failures and repair events in distinct parts of the system. In this way, this paper proposes hierarchical models that describe the behavior of major IT systems and IoT device components and assess the DDoS effects on system availability. Therefore, we evaluate the impact of the DDoS attacks on computing systems using IoT devices in attack amplification. We assessed equations that estimate the attack feasibility, pain factor, attack propensity, attacker benefits, and technical ability. They enable a direct analytical solution for large systems. The attack tree indices show the impact of simultaneous attacks on a computer system and the several threats that will maximize the system downtime. The attack tree investigation results allow for planning and improving the system's availability, maintainability, and reliability.\"\n              }\n            />\n\n            <Papers\n              year={2021}\n              title={\n                \"A software maintenance methodology: An approach applied to software aging\"\n              }\n              link={\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9447082/\"}\n              metaData={\n                \"2021 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)\"\n              }\n              abstract={\n                \"The increasing use of computational systems has highlighted concerns about attributes that may influence the quality of service, such as performance, availability, reliability, and maintenance capacity. Failures in the software development process may impact these attributes. Flawed code and overall software misdesign may cause internal errors, leading to system malfunction. Some errors might be identified and fixed during the software testing process. However, other errors may manifest only during the production stage. This is the case of the software aging phenomenon, which is related to the progressive degradation that a software performance or reliability suffers during its operational life. This paper proposes a methodology for software maintenance that is tailored to identify, correct, and mitigate the software aging effects. If the source code can be modified and a new version deployed with minimal impact, thus data from aging detection is used for corrective maintenance, i.e., for fixing the bug that causes the aging effects. If the software cannot be fixed nor its version updated without long system interruption or other bad consequences, then our approach can mitigate the aging effects, in a preventive maintenance to avoid service outages. The proposed methodology is validated through both Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) models and experiments in a controlled environment. The model evaluation considering a hybrid maintenance routine (preventive and corrective) yielded an availability of 99.82%, representing an annual downtime of 15.9 hours. By contrast, the baseline scenario containing only reactive maintenance (i.e., repairing only after failure) had more than 1342 hours of annual downtime- 80 times higher than the proposed approach.\"\n              }\n            />\n\n            <div id=\"hybrid-paper\">\n              <Papers\n                year={2019}\n                title={\n                  \"A Hybrid Mechanism of Horizontal Auto-scaling Based on Thresholds and Time Series\"\n                }\n                link={\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8914522/\"}\n                metaData={\n                  \"2019 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)\"\n                }\n                abstract={\n                  \"Demand for performance, availability, and reliability in computational systems has increased lately.

Therefore, proactive actions, also known as software rejuvenation must be performed to avoid these issues. The identification of the best moment to perform software rejuvenation is not a simple task, mostly because it may affect the system's availability and reliability. To overcome this problem, we propose an automatic forecasting strategy to support the system administrators to choose the best moment to perform software rejuvenation. Our strategy uses six time series techniques: Drift, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt, Holt-Winters, Linear Regression, and ARIMA. In our proposal, the most suitable one is chosen automatically as the best fit for a particular scenario. Three case studies were performed to evaluate the efficiency of our automatic strategy. Our proposal aims to increase the system's availability while decreasing the QoS violation probability. In one of our experiments, we can observe a reduction of 92.3% in the system's downtime.
