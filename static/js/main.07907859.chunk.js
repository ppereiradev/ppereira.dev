So far, in the literature, there is not a clear-cut difference between fog and edge computing, which may be confusing when defining edge and fog environments; however, it is essential to differentiate both paradigms. Edge computing concentrates on the end-devices side, while fog computing concentrates on the infrastructure. Edge computing is the layer that performs local computing or sensor metering. It is worth pointing out that edge computing environments run specific applications in the end-devices (e.g., self-driving cars, healthcare monitors, etc.). On the other hand, fog computing is an extension of the cloud computing paradigm, where the computational resources are extended to near the edge devices. Services are also provided by fog computing environments, which can be used through the Internet or private networks. My Master's dissertation was about autoscaling of virtual machines in cloud computing environments, where I used time-series forecasting to predict the most suitable moment to perform the scaling activity.

For instance, the Internet of Things environments are composed of many connected devices that generate data for applications, where many of them are latency-sensitive, such as facial recognition security systems in airports or train stations. To overcome the latency of the cloud infrastructure, researchers introduced the edge and fog computing paradigms in order to increase computing power between the cloud and devices. In this study, we propose analytical availability models; also, we evaluate the availability of physical edge and fog nodes running applications. To finish, we perform a capacity-oriented availability and a cost evaluation comparing edge and fog environments. Some of the results show that we can improve the availability from 2.96 number of nines to 5.93, by using our analytical models to plan the infrastructure.

Cloud computing has long been established as the main mechanism to test, develop, and deliver new applications and services in a distributed manner across the World Wide Web. Large data centers host many services and store petabytes of user data. Infrastructure and services owners rule the access to data and may even be able to change contents and attest to its veracity. Blockchain is a step towards a future where the user\u2019s data are considered safer, besides being public. Advances in blockchain-based technologies, now, support service provisioning over permissioned and private infrastructures. Therefore, organizations or groups of individuals may share information, service even if they do not trust each other, besides supporting infrastructure management tasks. This paper presents and evaluates models for assessing the availability and capacity-oriented availability of cloud computing infrastructures.

We can also see the Internet to be used in many areas, for innumerable purposes, and, currently, it is even used by objects. This evolution leads to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. This new concept can be defined as a system composed of storage resources, sensor devices, controllers, applications, and network infrastructure, in order to provide specific services to its users. Since IoT comprises heterogeneous components, the creation of these systems, the communication, and maintenance of their components became a complex task. In this paper, we present a dependability model to evaluate an IoT system. Amid different systems, we chose to assess availability in a smart building. The proposed models allow us to calculate estimations of other measures besides steady-state availability, such as reliability. Thus, it was possible to notice that there was no considerable gain of availability in the system when applying grid-tie solar power or off-grid solar power. The grid-tie solar power system is cheaper than the off-grid solar power system, even though it produces more energy. However, in our research, we were able to observe that the off-grid solar power system recovers the applied financial investment in smaller interval of time."}),i.a.createElement(L,{year:2020,title:"Stochastic performance model for web server capacity planning in fog computing",link:"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11227-020-03218-w.pdf",metaData:"The Journal of Supercomputing",abstract:"Cloud computing is attractive mostly because it allows companies to increase and decrease available resources, which makes them seem limitless. Although cloud computing has many advantages, there are still several issues such as unpredictable latency and no mobility support. To overcome these problems, fog computing extends communication, storage, and computation toward the edge of network. Therefore, fog computing may support delay-sensitive applications, which means that the application latency from end users can be improved, and it also decreases energy consumption and traffic congestion. The demand for performance, availability, and reliability in computational systems grows every day. To optimize these features, it is necessary to improve the resource utilization such as CPU, network bandwidth, memory, and storage. Although fog computing extends the cloud computing resources and improves the quality of service, executing capacity planning is an effective approach to arranging a deterministic process for web-related activities, and it is one of the approaches of optimizing web performance. The goal of capacity planning in fog computing is preparing the system for an incoming workload, so we are able to optimize the system\u2019s utilization while minimizing the total task execution time, which happens before sending the load toward the cloud environment or not sending it at all. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a web server running in a fog environment. We also use QoS metrics to plan its capacity.

They have seen that this process is probably the most important effort to solve the classification problem. In this sense, there are techniques of Feature Learning for generate new features more suitable for classification model than conventional features. However, these techniques generally do not depend on knowledge domain and they can apply in various types of raw data. However, less agnostic approaches learn a type of knowledge restricted to the area studded. The audio data requires a specific knowledge type. There are many techniques that seek to improve the performance of the new generation of acoustic features, among which stands the technique that use evolutionary algorithms to explore analytical space of function. However, the efforts made leave opportunities for improvement. The purpose of this work is to propose and evaluate a multi-objective alternative to the exploitation of analytical audio features.

However, it increases the demand for performance and reliability. Resources such as CPU, memory, storage and network bandwidth, are very susceptible of presenting software aging issues. Therefore, proactive actions, also known as software rejuvenation must be performed to avoid these issues. The identification of the best moment to perform software rejuvenation is not a simple task, mostly because it may affect the system's availability and reliability. To overcome this problem, we propose an automatic forecasting strategy to support the system administrators to choose the best moment to perform software rejuvenation. Our strategy uses six time series techniques: Drift, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt, Holt-Winters, Linear Regression, and ARIMA. In our proposal, the most suitable one is chosen automatically as the best fit for a particular scenario. Three case studies were performed to evaluate the efficiency of our automatic strategy. Our proposal aims to increase the system's availability while decreasing the QoS violation probability. In one of our experiments, we can observe a reduction of 92.3% in the system's downtime.
